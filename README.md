Social Media Platform

Description:
The Social Media Platform project is a modern web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It provides users with a platform to connect, share content, and interact with one another. The platform offers a range of functionalities including user authentication, post creation, social interactions such as liking and following, and profile customization.

Technologies Used:

MongoDB: The project utilizes MongoDB as the database system for storing user data, posts, and other relevant information. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability make it suitable for handling the dynamic nature of social media platforms.
Express.js: Express.js is employed as the backend framework to build RESTful APIs, handle routing, and manage HTTP requests/responses. It provides a robust foundation for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
React: The frontend of the platform is developed using React, a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture enables the creation of reusable UI elements and facilitates a smooth user experience.
Node.js: Node.js serves as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. It powers the backend of the application, enabling server-side logic implementation and integration with the frontend.

Key Functionalities Implemented:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts by registering with their email and password. Authentication mechanisms are implemented to ensure secure login and access control.
Post Creation: Authenticated users can create posts, sharing various types of content such as text, images, or links with the community.
Social Interactions: Users can engage with posts by liking or unliking them, expressing their appreciation or agreement with the content. Additionally, users can follow or unfollow other users to stay updated with their activities.
Profile Customization: Users have the option to customize their profiles by updating information such as their username, profile picture, bio, etc.
RESTful APIs: The backend of the application is built using Express.js to develop RESTful APIs. These APIs handle user authentication, post creation, profile updates, and other functionalities, providing a structured and standardized way to interact with the server.
CRUD Operations: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are implemented for different entities within the application, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete posts and profile information.
